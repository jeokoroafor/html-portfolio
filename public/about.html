<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Joseph Okoroafor. I was trained at the Federal
  University of Technology Owerri for five years. The institution
  awarded me with a Bachelors of Technology afterwards.
</p>

<p>Since graduation I have developed my skillsets in brand storytelling alongside my
  transport management which I studied. I have helped every business I have worked with
  grow their business and ensure proper management of the business assigned me.
</p>

<p>This is the 27th time I am starting afresh to learn coding and I want this to count. So I am putting more time to it.</p>
